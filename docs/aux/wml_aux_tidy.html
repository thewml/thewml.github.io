  Introduction to TIDY
<P>
   When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be
   nice if there was a simple way to fix these mistakes
   automatically and tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out
   markup? Well now there is! Dave Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free
   utility for doing just that. It also works great on the
   atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML
   editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where
   you need to pay further attention on making your pages more
   accessible to people with disabilities.
<P>
   Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring
   to your attention things that you need to work on yourself.
   Each item found is listed with the line number and column so
   that you can see where the problem lies in your markup. Tidy
   won't generate a cleaned up version when there are problems
   that it can't be sure of how to handle. These are logged as
   "errors" rather than "warnings".
<P>
   Tidy features in a recent article on XHTML by webreview.com.
<P>
  Examples of TIDY at work
<P>
   Tidy corrects the markup in a way that matches where possible
   the observed rendering in popular browsers from Netscape and
   Microsoft. Here are just a few examples of how TIDY perfects
   your HTML for you:
<UL>
  <LI>Missing or mismatched end tags are detected and corrected
   &lt;h1&gt;heading
   &lt;h2&gt;subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
<P>
       is mapped to
   &lt;h1&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;subheading&lt;/h2&gt;
  <LI>End tags in the wrong order are corrected:
   &lt;p&gt;here is a para &lt;b&gt;bold &lt;i&gt;bold italic&lt;/b&gt; bold?&lt;/i&gt; normal?
<P>
       is mapped to
   &lt;p&gt;here is a para &lt;b&gt;bold &lt;i&gt;bold italic&lt;/i&gt; bold?&lt;/b&gt; normal?
  <LI>Fixes problems with heading emphasis
   &lt;h1&gt;&lt;i&gt;italic heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;new paragraph
<P>
       In Netscape and Internet Explorer this causes everything
       following the heading to be in the heading font size, not
       the desired effect at all!
       Tidy maps the example to
   &lt;h1&gt;&lt;i&gt;italic heading&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;new paragraph
  <LI>Recovers from mixed up tags
   &lt;i&gt;&lt;h1&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;new paragraph &lt;b&gt;bold text
   &lt;p&gt;some more bold text
<P>
       Tidy maps this to
   &lt;h1&gt;&lt;i&gt;heading&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;new paragraph &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;some more bold text&lt;/b&gt;
  <LI>Getting the &lt;hr&gt; in the right place:
   &lt;h1&gt;&lt;hr&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;sub&lt;hr&gt;heading&lt;/h2&gt;
<P>
       Tidy maps this to
   &lt;hr&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;sub&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;hr&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;heading&lt;/h2&gt;
  <LI>Adding the missing "/" in end tags for anchors:
   &lt;a href="#refs"&gt;References&lt;a&gt;
<P>
       Tidy maps this to
   &lt;a href="#refs"&gt;References&lt;/a&gt;
  <LI>Perfecting lists by putting in tags missed out:
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;1st list item
   &lt;li&gt;2nd list item
<P>
       is mapped to
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;1st list item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;2nd list item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
  <LI>Missing quotes around attribute values are added
       Tidy inserts quote marks around all attribute values for
       you. It can also detect when you have forgotten the
       closing quote mark, although this is something you will
       have to fix yourself.
  <LI>Unknown/Proprietary attributes are reported
       Tidy has a comprehensive knowledge of the attributes
       defined in the HTML 4.0 recommendation from W3C. This
       often allows you to spot where you have mistyped an
       attribute or value.
  <LI>Proprietary elements are recognized and reported as such.
       Tidy will even work out which version of HTML you are
       using and insert the appropriate DOCTYPE element, as per
       the W3C recommendations.
  <LI>Tags lacking a terminating '&gt;' are spotted
       This is something you then have to fix yourself as Tidy is
       unsure of where the &gt; should be inserted.
</UL>
<P>
  Layout style
<P>
   You can choose which style you want Tidy to use when it
   generates the cleaned up markup: for instance whether you like
   elements to indent their contents or not. Several people have
   asked if Tidy could preserve the original layout. I am sorry
   to say that this would be very hard to support due to the way
   Tidy is implemented. Tidy starts by building a clean parse
   tree from the source file. The parse tree doesn't contain any
   information about the original layout. Tidy then pretty prints
   the parse tree using the current layout options. Trying to
   preserve the original layout would interact badly with the
   repair operations needed to build a clean parse tree and
   considerably complicate the code.
<P>
   Some browsers can screw up the right alignment of text
   depending on how you layout headings. As an example, consider:
&lt;h1 align="right"&gt;<BR>
  Heading<BR>
&lt;/h1&gt;
<P>
&lt;h1 align="right"&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
<P>
   Both of these should be rendered the same. Sadly a common
   browser bug fails to trim trailing whitespace and misaligns
   the first heading. HTML Tidy will protect you from this bug,
   except when you set the indent option to "yes".
<P>
   Setting the indent option to yes can also cause problems with
   table layout for some browsers:<BR>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="foo.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<BR>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="foo.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
<P>
   will look slightly different from:<BR>
&lt;td&gt;<BR>
  &lt;img src="foo.gif"&gt;<BR>
&lt;/td&gt;<BR>
&lt;td&gt;<BR>
  &lt;img src="foo.gif"&gt;<BR>
&lt;/td&gt;
<P>
   You can avoid such quirks by using indent: no or indent: auto
   in the config file.
<P>
  Internationalization issues
<P>
   Tidy offers you a choice of character encodings: US ASCII, ISO
   Latin-1, UTF-8 and the ISO 2022 family of 7 bit encodings. The
   full set of HTML 4.0 entities are defined. Cleaned up output
   uses HTML entity names for characters when appropriate.
   Otherwise characters outside the normal range are output as
   numeric character entities. Tidy defaults to assuming you want
   the output to be in US ASCII. Tidy doesn't yet recognize the
   use of the HTML meta element for specifying the character
   encoding.
<P>
  Accessibility
<P>
   Tidy offers advice on accessibility problems for people using
   non-graphical browsers. The most common thing you will see is
   the suggestion you add a summary attribute to table elements.
   The idea is to provide a summary of the table's role and
   structure suitable for use with aural browsers.
<P>
  Cleaning up presentational markup
<P>
   Many tools generate HTML with an excess of FONT, NOBR and
   CENTER tags. Tidy's -clean option will replace them by style
   properties and rules using CSS. This makes the markup easier
   to read and maintain as well as reducing the file size! Tidy
   is expected to get smarter at this in the future.
<P>
   Some pages rely on the presentation effects of isolated &lt;p&gt; or
   &lt;/p&gt; tags.Tidy deletes empty paragraph and heading elements
   etc. The use of empty paragraph elements is not recommended
   for adding vertical whitespace. Instead use style sheets, or
   the &lt;br&gt; element. Tidy won't discard paragraphs only
   containing a nonbreaking space &amp;nbsp;
<P>
  Teaching Tidy about new tags!
<P>
   You can teach Tidy about new tags by declaring them in the
   configuration file, the syntax is:<BR>
  new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3<BR>
  new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3<BR>
  new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
  new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
<P>
   The same tag can be defined as empty and as inline or as empty
   and as block.
<P>
   These declarations can be combined to define an a new empty
   inline or empty block element, but you are not advised to
   declare tags as being both inline and block!
<P>
   Note that the new tags can only appear where Tidy expects
   inline or block-level tags respectively. This means you can't
   (yet) place new tags within the document head or other
   contexts with restricted content models. So far the most
   popular use of this feature is to allow Tidy to be applied to
   Cold Fusion files.
<P>
   I am working on ways to make it easy to customize the
   permitted document syntax using assertion grammars, and hope
   to apply this to a much smarter version of Tidy for release
   later this year or early next year.
<P>
  Limited support for ASP, JSTE and PHP
<P>
   Tidy is somewhat aware of the preprocessing language called
   ASP which uses a pseudo element syntax &lt;% ... %&gt; to include
   preprocessor directives. ASP is normally interpreted by the
   web server before delivery to the browser. JSTE shares the
   same syntax, but sometimes also uses &lt;# ... #&gt;. Tidy can also
   cope with another such language called PHP, which uses the
   syntax &lt;?php ... ?&gt;
<P>
   Tidy will cope with ASP, JSTE and PHP pseudo elements within
   element content and as replacements for attributes, for
   example:<BR>
  &lt;option &lt;% if rsSchool.Fields("ID").Value
<UL>
  <LI>session("sessSchoolID")
    then Response.Write("selected") %&gt;
    value='&lt;%=rsSchool.Fields("ID").Value%&gt;'&gt;
    &lt;%=rsSchool.Fields("Name").Value%&gt;
    (&lt;%=rsSchool.Fields("ID").Value%&gt;)
  &lt;/option&gt;
</UL>
<P>
   Note that Tidy doesn't understand the scripting language used
   within pseudo elements and attributes, and can easily get
   confused. Tidy may report missing attributes when these are
   hidden within preprocessor code. Tidy can also get things
   wrong if the code includes quote marks, e.g. if the example
   above is changed to:<BR>
    value="&lt;%=rsSchool.Fields("ID").Value%&gt;"
<P>
   Tidy will now see the quote mark preceding ID as ending the
   attribute value, and proceed to complain about what follows.
   Note you can choose whether to allow line wrapping on spaces
   within pseudo elements or not using the wrap-asp option. If
   you used ASP, JSTE or PHP to create a start tag, but placed
   the end tag explicitly in the markup, Tidy won't be able to
   match them up, and will delete the end tag for you. So in this
   case you are advise to make the start tag explicit and to use
   ASP, JSTE or PHP for just the attributes, e.g.
   &lt;a href="&lt;%=random.site()%&gt;"&gt;do you feel lucky?&lt;/a&gt;
<P>
   Tidy allows you to control whether line wrapping is enabled
   for ASP, JSTE and PHP instructions, see the wrap-asp,
   wrap-jste and wrap-php config options, respectively.
<P>
   I regret that Tidy does not support Tango preprocessing
   instructions which look like:<BR>
&lt;@if variable_1='a'&gt;
<P>
    do something<BR>
&lt;@else&gt;
<P>
    do nothing<BR>
&lt;/@if&gt;
<P>
&lt;@include &lt;@cgi&gt;&lt;@appfilepath&gt;includes/message.html&gt;
<P>
   Tidy supports another preprocessing syntax called "Tango", but
   only for attribute values. Adding support for pseudo elements
   written in Tango looks as if it would be quite tough, so I
   would like to gauge the level of interest before committing to
   this work.
<P>
  Limited support for XML
<P>
   XML processors compliant with W3C's XML 1.0 recommendation are
   very picky about which files they will accept. Tidy can help
   you to fix errors that cause your XML files to be rejected.
   Tidy doesn't yet recognize all XML features though, e.g. it
   doesn't understand CDATA sections or DTD subsets.
<P>
  Creating Slides
<P>
   The -slides option allows you to burst a single HTML file into
   a number of linked slides. Each H2 element in the input file
   is treated as delimiting the start of the next slide. The
   slides are named slide1.html, slide2.html, slide3.html etc.
   This is a relatively new feature and ideas are welcomed as to
   how to improve it. In particular, I plan to add support to the
   configuration file for setting the style sheet for slides and
   for customizing the slides via a template.
<P>
   I would be interested in hearing from anyone who can offer
   help with using JavaScript for adding dynamic effects to
   slides, for instance similar to those available in Microsoft
   PowerPoint.
<P>
  Indenting text for a better layout
<P>
   Indenting the content of elements makes the markup easier to
   read. Tidy can do this for all elements or just for those
   where it's needed. The auto-indent mode has been used below to
   avoid indenting the content of title, p and li elements:
&lt;html&gt;<BR>
  &lt;head&gt;<BR>
    &lt;title&gt;Test document&lt;/title&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/head&gt;
<P>
  &lt;body&gt;<BR>
    &lt;p&gt;para which has enough text to cause a line break,
    and so test the wrapping mechanism for long lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;<BR>
This is<BR>
&lt;em&gt;genuine
<P>
       preformatted&lt;/em&gt;<BR>
   text<BR>
&lt;/pre&gt;
<P>
    &lt;ul&gt;<BR>
      &lt;li&gt;1st list item&lt;/li&gt;
<P>
      &lt;li&gt;2nd list item&lt;/li&gt;<BR>
    &lt;/ul&gt;<BR>
    &lt;!-- end comment --&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/body&gt;<BR>
&lt;/html&gt;
<P>
   Indenting the content does increase the size of the file, so
   you may prefer Tidy's default style:
 &lt;html&gt;<BR>
 &lt;head&gt;<BR>
 &lt;title&gt;Test document&lt;/title&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/head&gt;<BR>
 &lt;body&gt;<BR>
 &lt;p&gt;para which has enough text to cause a line break,
 and so test the wrapping mechanism for long lines.&lt;/p&gt;
<P>
 &lt;pre&gt;This is<BR>
 &lt;em&gt;genuine
<P>
       preformatted&lt;/em&gt;<BR>
    text<BR>
 &lt;/pre&gt;
<P>
 &lt;ul&gt;<BR>
 &lt;li&gt;1st list item &lt;/li&gt;
<P>
 &lt;li&gt;2nd list item&lt;/li&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/ul&gt;
<P>
 &lt;!-- end comment --&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/body&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/html&gt;
<P>
  How to run tidy
<P>
   tidy [[options] filename]*
<P>
   HTML tidy is not (yet) a Windows program. If you run tidy
   without any arguments, it will just sit there waiting to read
   markup on the stdin stream. Tidy's input and output default to
   stdin and stdout respectively. Errors are written to stderr
   but can be redirected to a file with the -f filename option.
<P>
   I generally use the -m option to get tidy to update the
   original file, and if the file is particularly bad I also use
   the -f option to write the errors to a file to make it easier
   to review them. Tidy supports a small set of character
   encoding options. The default is ASCII, which makes it easy to
   edit markup in regular text editors.
<P>
   For instance:<BR>
   tidy -f errs.txt -m index.html
<P>
   which runs tidy on the file "index.html" updating it in place
   and writing the error messages to the file "errs.txt". Its a
   good idea to save your work before tidying it, as with all
   complex software, tidy may have bugs. If you find any please
   let me know!
<P>
   Thanks to Jacek Niedziela, The Win32 executable for tidy is
   now able to example wild cards in filenames. This utilizes the
   setargv library supplied with VC++.
<P>
   Tidy writes errors to stderr, and won't be paused by the more
   command. A work around is to redirect stderr to stdout as
   follows. This works on Unix and Windows NT, but not on other
   platforms. My thanks to Markus Wolf for this tip!
   tidy file.html 2&gt;&amp;1 | more
<P>
    Tidy's Options
<P>
   To get a list of available options use:
   tidy -help
<P>
   You may want to run it through more to view the help a page at
   a time.<BR>
   tidy -help | more
<P>
   Input and Output default to stdin/stdout respectively. Single
   letter options apart from -f may be combined as in: tidy -f
   errs.txt -imu foo.html
<P>
   Matej Vela &lt;vela@debian.org&gt; has written a Unix man page for
   Tidy, but for the latest details on config options and for the
   release notes please visit this page:
   http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy.
<P>
  Using a Configuration File
<P>
   Tidy now supports a configuration file, and this is now much
   the most convenient way to configure Tidy. Assuming you have
   created a config file named "config.txt" (the name doesn't
   matter), you can instruct Tidy to use it via the command line
   option -config config.txt, e.g.<BR>
   tidy -config config.txt file1.html file2.html
<P>
   Alternatively, you can name the default config file via the
   environment variable named "HTML_TIDY". Note this should be
   the absolute path since you are likely to want to run Tidy in
   different directories. You can also set a config file at
   compile time by defining CONFIG_FILE as the path string, see
   platform.h.
<P>
   You can now set config options on the command line by
   preceding the name of the option immediately (no intervening
   space) by "--", for example:<BR>
  tidy --break-before-br true --show-warnings false
<P>
   The following options are supported:
<P>
   tidy-mark: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes (the default) Tidy will add a meta
          element to the document head to indicate that the
          document has been tidied. To suppress this, set
          tidy-mark to no. Tidy won't add a meta element if one
          is already present.
</PRE>
<P>
   markup: bool
<PRE>
          Determines whether Tidy generates a pretty printed
          version of the markup. Bool values are either yes or
          no. Note that Tidy won't generate a pretty printed
          version if it finds unknown tags, or missing trailing
          quotes on attribute values, or missing trailing '&gt;' on
          tags. The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   wrap: number
<PRE>
          Sets the right margin for line wrapping. Tidy tries to
          wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length. The
          default is 66. Set wrap to zero if you want to disable
          line wrapping.
</PRE>
<P>
   wrap-attributes: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, attribute values may be wrapped across
          lines for easier editing. The default is no. This
          option can be set independently of wrap-scriptlets

<P>
   wrap-script-literals: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this allows lines to be wrapped within
          string literals that appear in script attributes. The
          default is no. The example shows how Tidy wraps a
          really really long script string literal inserting a
          backslash character before the linebreak:
</PRE>
<P>
&lt;a href="somewhere.html" onmouseover="document.status = '...some \
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, \
really, really long string..';"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;
<P>
   wrap-asp: bool
<PRE>
          If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped
          within ASP pseudo elements, which look like: &lt;% ... %&gt;.
          The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   wrap-jste: bool
<PRE>
          If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped
          within JSTE pseudo elements, which look like:
          &lt;# ... #&gt;. The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   wrap-php: bool
<PRE>
          If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped
          within PHP pseudo elements. The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   literal-attributes: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this ensures that whitespace characters
          within attribute values are passed through unchanged.
          The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   tab-size: number
<PRE>
          Sets the number of columns between successive tab
          stops. The default is 4. It is used to map tabs to
          spaces when reading files. Tidy never outputs files
          with tabs.
</PRE>
<P>
   indent: no, yes or auto
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will indent block-level tags. The
          default is no. If set to auto Tidy will decide whether
          or not to indent the content of tags such as title,
          h1-h6, li, td, th, or p depending on whether or not the
          content includes a block-level element. You are advised
          to avoid setting indent to yes as this can expose
          layout bugs in some browsers.
</PRE>
<P>
   indent-spaces: number
<PRE>
          Sets the number of spaces to indent content when
          indentation is enabled. The default is 2 spaces.
</PRE>
<P>
   indent-attributes: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, each attribute will begin on a new line.
          The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   hide-endtags: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, optional end-tags will be omitted when
          generating the pretty printed markup. This option is
          ignored if you are outputting to XML. The default is
          no.
</PRE>
<P>
   input-xml: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will use the XML parser rather than
          the error correcting HTML parser. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   output-xml: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will use generate the pretty
          printed output writing it as well-formed XML. Any
          entities not defined in XML 1.0 will be written as
          numeric entities to allow them to be parsed by an XML
          parser. The tags and attributes will be in the case
          used in the input document, regardless of other
          options. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   add-xml-pi: bool<BR>
   add-xml-decl: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will add the XML declatation when
          outputting XML or XHTML. The default is no. Note that
          if the input document includes an &lt;?xml?&gt; declaration
          then it will appear in the output independent of the
          value of this option.
</PRE>
<P>
   output-xhtml: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will generate the pretty printed
          output writing it as extensible HTML. The default is
          no. This option causes Tidy to set the doctype and
          default namespace as appropriate to XHTML. If a doctype
          or namespace is given they will checked for consistency
          with the content of the document. In the case of an
          inconsistency, the corrected values will appear in the
          output. For XHTML, entities can be written as named or
          numeric entities according to the value of the
          "numeric-entities" property. The tags and attributes
          will be output in the case used in the input document,
          regardless of other options.
</PRE>
<P>
   doctype: omit, auto, strict, loose or &lt;fpi&gt;
<PRE>
          This property controls the doctype declaration
          generated by Tidy. If set to omit the output file won't
          contain a doctype declaration. If set to auto (the
          default) Tidy will use an educated guess based upon the
          contents of the document. If set to strict, Tidy will
          set the doctype to the strict DTD. If set to loose, the
          doctype is set to the loose (transitional) DTD.
          Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal
          public identifier (fpi) for example:
</PRE>
<P>
    doctype: "-//ACME//DTD HTML 3.14159//EN"
<PRE>
          If you specify the fpi for an XHTML document, Tidy will
          set the system identifier to the empty string. Tidy
          leaves the document type for generic XML documents
          unchanged.
</PRE>
<P>
   char-encoding: raw, ascii, latin1, utf8 or iso2022
<PRE>
          Determines how Tidy interprets character streams. For
          ascii, Tidy will accept Latin-1 character values, but
          will use entities for all characters whose value &gt; 127.
          For raw, Tidy will output values above 127 without
          translating them into entities. For latin1 characters
          above 255 will be written as entities. For utf8, Tidy
          assumes that both input and output is encoded as UTF-8.
          You can use iso2022 for files encoded using the ISO2022
          family of encodings e.g. ISO 2022-JP. The default is
          ascii.
</PRE>
<P>
   numeric-entities: bool
<PRE>
          Causes entities other than the basic XML 1.0 named
          entities to be written in the numeric rather than the
          named entity form. The default is no
</PRE>
<P>
   quote-marks: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes " characters to be written
          out as &amp;quot; as is preferred by some editing
          environments. The apostrophe character ' is written out
          as &amp;#39; since many web browsers don't yet support
          &amp;apos;. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   quote-nbsp: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes non-breaking space
          characters to be written out as entities, rather than
          as the Unicode character value 160 (decimal). The
          default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   quote-ampersand: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes unadorned &amp; characters to be
          written out as &amp;amp;. The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   assume-xml-procins: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this changes the parsing of processing
          instructions to require ?&gt; as the terminator rather
          than &gt;. The default is no. This option is automatically
          set if the input is in XML.
</PRE>
<P>
   fix-backslash: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes backslash characters "\" in
          URLs to be replaced by forward slashes "/". The default
          is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   break-before-br: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will output a line break before
          each &lt;br&gt; element. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   uppercase-tags: bool
<PRE>
          Causes tag names to be output in upper case. The
          default is no resulting in lowercase, except for XML
          input where the original case is preserved.
</PRE>
<P>
   uppercase-attributes: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes attribute names are output in upper case.
          The default is no resulting in lowercase, except for
          XML where the original case is preserved.
</PRE>
<P>
   word-2000: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will go to great pains to strip out
          all the surplus stuff Microsoft Word 2000 inserts when
          you save Word documents as "Web pages". The default is
          no. Note that Tidy doesn't yet know what to do with VML
          markup from Word, but in future I hope to be able to
          map VML to SVG.
          Microsoft has developed its own optional filter for
          exporting to HTML, and the 2.0 version is much
          improved. You can download the filter free from the
          Microsoft Office Update site.
</PRE>
<P>
   clean: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, causes Tidy to strip out surplus
          presentational tags and attributes replacing them by
          style rules and structural markup as appropriate. It
          works well on the html saved from Microsoft Office'97.
          The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   logical-emphasis: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, causes Tidy to replace any occurrence of
          i by em and any occurrence of b by strong. In both
          cases, the attributes are preserved unchanged. The
          default is no. This option can now be set independently
          of the clean and drop-font-tags options.
</PRE>
<P>
   drop-empty-paras: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, empty paragraphs will be discarded. If
          set to no, empty paragraphs are replaced by a pair of
          br elements as HTML4 precludes empty paragraphs. The
          default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   drop-font-tags: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes together with the clean option (see
          above), Tidy will discard font and center tags rather
          than creating the corresponding style rules. The
          default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   enclose-text: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes Tidy to enclose any text it
          finds in the body element within a p element. This is
          useful when you want to take an existing html file and
          use it with a style sheet. Any text at the body level
          will screw up the margins, but wrap the text within a p
          element and all is well! The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   enclose-block-text: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes Tidy to insert a p element
          to enclose any text it finds in any element that allows
          mixed content for HTML transitional but not HTML
          strict. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   fix-bad-comments: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes Tidy to replace unexpected
          hyphens with "=" characters when it comes across
          adjacent hyphens. The default is yes. This option is
          provided for users of Cold Fusion which uses the
          comment syntax: &lt;!--- ---&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
   add-xml-space: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, this causes Tidy to add
          xml:space="preserve" to elements such as pre, style and
          script when generating XML. This is needed if the
          whitespace in such elements is to be parsed
          appropriately without having access to the DTD. The
          default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   alt-text: string
<PRE>
          This allows you to set the default alt text for img
          attributes. This feature is dangerous as it suppresses
          further accessibility warnings. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
          MAKING YOUR DOCUMENTS ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T
          SEE THE IMAGES!!!
</PRE>
<P>
   write-back: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy will write back the tidied markup
          to the same file it read from. The default is no. You
          are advised to keep copies of important files before
          tidying them as on rare occasions the result may not
          always be what you expect.
</PRE>
<P>
   keep-time: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy won't alter the last modified time
          for files it writes back to. The default is yes. This
          allows you to tidy files without effecting which ones
          will be uploaded to the Web server when using a tool
          such as 'SiteCopy'. Note that this feature may not work
          on some platforms.
</PRE>
<P>
   error-file: filename
<PRE>
          Writes errors and warnings to the named file rather
          than to stderr.
</PRE>
<P>
   show-warnings: bool
<PRE>
          If set to no, warnings are suppressed. This can be
          useful when a few errors are hidden in a flurry of
          warnings. The default is yes.
</PRE>
<P>
   quiet: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy won't output the welcome message or
          the summary of the numbers of errors and warnings. The
          default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   gnu-emacs: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes, Tidy changes the format for reporting
          errors and warnings to a format that is more easily
          parsed by GNU Emacs. The default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   split: bool
<PRE>
          If set to yes Tidy will use the input file to create a
          sequence of slides, splitting the markup prior to each
          successive &lt;h2&gt;. You can see an example of the results
          in a recent talk I made on XHTML. The slides are
          written to "slide1.html", "slide2.html" etc. The
          default is no.
</PRE>
<P>
   new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
<PRE>
          Use this to declare new empty inline tags. The option
          takes a space or comma separated list of tag names.
          Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to
          generate a tidied file if the input includes previously
          unknown tags. Remember to also declare empty tags as
          either inline or blocklevel, see below.
</PRE>
<P>
   new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
<PRE>
          Use this to declare new non-empty inline tags. The
          option takes a space or comma separated list of tag
          names. Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to
          generate a tidied file if the input includes previously
          unknown tags.
</PRE>
<P>
   new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
<PRE>
          Use this to declare new block-level tags. The option
          takes a space or comma separated list of tag names.
          Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to
          generate a tidied file if the input includes previously
          unknown tags. Note you can't change the content model
          for elements such as table, ul, ol and dl. This is
          explained in more detail in the release notes.
</PRE>
<P>
   new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
<PRE>
          Use this to declare new tags that are to be processed
          in exactly the same way as HTML's pre element. The
          option takes a space or comma separated list of tag
          names. Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to
          generate a tidied file if the input includes previously
          unknown tags. Note you can't as yet add new CDATA
          elements (similar to script).
</PRE>

  Using Tidy from scripts
<P>
   If you want to run Tidy from a Perl or other scripting
   language you may find it of value to inspect the result
   returned by Tidy when it exits: 0 if everything is fine, 1 if
   there were warnings and 2 if there were errors. This is an
   example using Perl:<BR>
if (close(TIDY) == 0) {<BR>
  my $exitcode = $? &gt;&gt; 8;<BR>
  if ($exitcode == 1) {<BR>
    printf STDERR "tidy issued warning messages\n";
  } elsif ($exitcode == 2) {<BR>
    printf STDERR "tidy issued error messages\n";
  } else {<BR>
    die "tidy exited with code: $exitcode\n";
  }<BR>

<P>
  Integrating Tidy as part of other Software
<P>
   You can also incorporate Tidy as part of a larger program, for
   instance in HTML editors or HTML transformation tools used for
   import filters, or for when you want to customize Web content
   to get the best out of different kinds of browsers. Imagine
   authoring clean HTML with CSS and at a touch of a button
   producing variants that look great and work reliably on a
   large variety of different browsers, taking into account the
   quirks of each. For instance, providing the ability to tune
   content for different versions of Netscape and Internet
   Explorer, and for browsers running on set-top boxes for
   televisions, handheld and palmtop devices, cell phones, and
   voice browsers. I am happy to quote for software development
   for such tools.

    Using Tidy from emacs
<P>
   Pete Gelbman emailed this tip for using Tidy with the Unix
   version of emacs. lets you highlight a region of text and run
   Tidy on it. Tidy's "fixed" output will replace your
   highlighted region right in place. The error/warnings output
   will be directed into a separate mini-buffer below in your
   main screen.

  Java port of HTML Tidy
<P>
   Andy Quick &lt;ac.quick@sympatico.ca&gt; maintains a Java port of
   Tidy, so you can now integrate Tidy into your Java
   applications. Andy is tracking the releases of Tidy in C (this
   page). More information is available on Andy's home page.

  Source Code
<P>
   The code is in ANSI C and uses the C standard library for i/o.
   The parser works top down, building a complete parse tree in
   memory. Document text is held as Unicode represented as UTF-8
   in a character buffer that expands as needed. The code has so
   far been tested on Windows'95, Windows'98, Windows NT, Windows
   2000, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Ultrix, OSF, OS/MP, IRIX,
   NeXtStep, MacOS, BeOS, OS/2, AIX, Amiga, Atari, SunOS,
   Solaris, IRIX and HP-UX, amongst others.

   Conventions for whether lines end with CRLF, LF or CR vary
   from one system to another. I have included the C source for a
   utility tab2space which can be used to ensure that files use
   the line end convention of your choice, and to expand tabs to
   spaces.<BR>
   tab2space -t4 -unix *.h *.c<BR>
   tab2space -tabs -unix Makefile
<P>
   Note use of "-tabs" to ensure that tabs are preserved in the
   Makefile (it won't work without them!).
<P>
   For those of you on Unix, here is a script you can use to
   strip carriage returns:<BR>
echo Stripping Carriage Returns from files...
for i<BR>
do
<PRE>
        if [ -f $i ]
        then
                if [ -w $i ]
                then
                        echo $i
                        tr -d '\015' &lt; $i &gt; toix.tmp
                        mv toix.tmp $i
                else
                        echo $i: write-protected
                fi
        else
                echo $i: not a file
        fi

done

   Save this script to a file, e.g. "scripcr" and use "chmod +x
   stripcr" to make it executable. You can then run it as
   "stripcr *.c *.h Overview.html Makefile"
